# Learning & Practice Workspace

This repository is intended for structured learning, hands-on practice, and reference implementations across **Spring Framework essentials** and **Core Java problem-solving**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in **Spring ecosystem basics**
- Practice and document **Core Java concepts and problems**
- Maintain a reusable knowledge base for interviews and real-world development

---

## 🛠️ Planned Work (TODO)

### 1. Spring Essentials – Basic Service
Create a minimal yet production-aligned Spring-based service covering core concepts.

**Scope:**
- Spring Boot project setup
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Configuration using `@Configuration` and `@Bean`
- REST controller with basic endpoints
- Service and repository layers
- Exception handling (global)
- Logging basics
- Profiles (dev/test)
- Gradle-based build configuration

**Outcome:**
A lightweight Spring application demonstrating essential architectural patterns and best practices.

---

### 2. Core Java – Problem Demonstrations
Implement and document commonly asked Core Java problems and concepts.

**Planned Topics:**
- OOP principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
- Collections framework
- Java Streams & Lambdas
- Exception handling
- Immutability and `equals` / `hashCode`
- Multithreading and concurrency basics
- Java memory model (heap vs stack)
- Common coding interview problems

**Outcome:**
Well-structured examples with explanations and edge-case considerations.
